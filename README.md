# PI_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from PI (Programowanie Imperatywne - Imperative Programming) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the exercises are written in Polish.

Command to run codes:
gcc -std=gnu11 -O2 -Wall -Wconversion -Werror -o exercise exercise.c -lm

## Licence
If you use this repository/code for classes or for something else, please give me a star or a fork :). It will help me know that my work is important and useful to someone.
