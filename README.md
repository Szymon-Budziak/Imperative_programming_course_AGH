# PI_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from PI (Programowanie Imperatywne - Imperative Programming) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the exercises are written in Polish.
Command to run codes:
gcc -std=gnu11 -O2 -Wall -Wconversion -Werror -o exercise exercise.c -lm
